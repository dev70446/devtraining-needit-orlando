> **Some info and suggest to public domain of hMailServer**

1.  Set up account hmailserver in server

**[Suggest:]{.underline}**

-   Server need config SSL but it need key and certificate files, we
    used open ssl to do that on local. How about server? IT will do that
    with trust certificate?

-   Suggest that system need public or do something to make sure client
    mail can access it from outsite for testing

-   If public, please check domain name pcsotest.com is ok or any name?
    please advise
