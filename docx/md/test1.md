**Some info and suggest to public domain of hMailServer**

1. Set up account hmailserver in server

**Suggest:**

- Server need config SSL but it need key and certificate files, we used open ssl to do that on local. How about server? IT will do that with trust certificate?

- Suggest that system need public or do something to make sure client mail can access it from outsite for testing

- If public, please check domain name pcsotest.com is ok or any name? please advise
